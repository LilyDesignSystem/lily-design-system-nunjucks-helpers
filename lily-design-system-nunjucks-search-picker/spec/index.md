# SearchPicker (Nunjucks) — Specification

Single source of truth for the `@lilydesignsystem/nunjucks-search-picker`
helper. This file drives implementation, testing, and documentation:
anything not in this spec is out of scope; anything in this spec must be
exercised by a test.

The canonical helper is the Svelte one
([`../../../lily-design-system-svelte-helpers/lily-design-system-svelte-search-picker/spec/index.md`](../../../lily-design-system-svelte-helpers/lily-design-system-svelte-search-picker/spec/index.md)).
Per `AGENTS/helpers.md`, Svelte wins where the catalogs disagree; §3.3
below records where this port's macro/client split changes the shape of
the API, and why.

Sibling files:

- `search-picker.njk` — the macro (server-rendered markup)
- `search-picker.client.js` — the runtime (open/close, focus, submit, navigation)
- `search-picker.test.ts` — vitest spec exercising every clause in §7
- `index.md` — user-facing guide

---

## 1. Goal

Give a Nunjucks application a drop-in, headless site-search control that:

1. Renders a single-icon button (a bundled magnifying-glass SVG) matching
   the other Lily page-header helpers.
2. Opens a dropdown holding a search text field and, at its right, a
   submit button whose visible label is `⏎` (U+23CE RETURN SYMBOL).
3. On Return in the field, or on activating the submit button, performs
   a GET navigation to `/?<query>` — searching for `foo` goes to `/?foo`.
4. Ships zero CSS.

## 2. Non-goals

- **Running the search.** The control only navigates; the page at
  `/?<query>` (or a custom `action`) does the searching.
- **Suggestions, autocomplete, or a results list.** This is a field and a
  submit button, not a combobox.
- **Persistence.** There is no preference to remember. Nothing is written
  to `localStorage`, and nothing is applied to the document root.
- **A named query parameter.** The contract is the bare query string
  (`/?foo`), not `/?q=foo`; see §3.1.

## 3. Architectural decisions

### 3.1 Inherited from the canonical helper

- **A helper that owns an action, like `share-picker`.** It applies
  nothing to the document and persists nothing.
- **A disclosure holding a real `<form role="search">`, not a menu.** A
  `type="search"` field and a `type="submit"` button, so
  Return-to-submit, mobile "search" keyboards and form semantics come
  from the platform. The form is a search landmark named by `label`.
- **The bare query, so navigation is done in script.** A native GET form
  submission always sends `name=value` pairs. The contract is `/?foo`,
  so the client cancels the native submission and navigates to
  `searchHref(query, action)` itself. The form keeps `action` /
  `method="get"` so its semantics stay truthful.
- **Encoded and trimmed.** `foo bar` goes to `/?foo%20bar`, `a&b` to
  `/?a%26b`. An empty or whitespace-only query navigates nowhere.
- **`navigate` is overridable.** The default is `location.assign(href)`;
  a client-side router passes its own navigate function.
- **`⏎` is the visible label, never the accessible name.** It renders in
  an `aria-hidden` span; the button's name is the required `submitLabel`.
  `label` and `inputLabel` are likewise required, with no English default.

### 3.2 The macro / client.js split

As with every helper in this catalog, the macro renders markup carrying
`data-lily-search-picker-*` hooks — with the panel `hidden` — and the
client module wires behaviour: toggling, focus, Escape, outside-click
and focus-out dismissal, and the submit. See §6 and `docs/ssr.md`.

### 3.3 Where the split reshapes the canonical API

None of these change behaviour; they move each canonical prop to the
side of the split that can actually honour it.

- **`navigate` and `onSearch` are client-only.** A Nunjucks macro cannot
  hold a function (only filters and globals registered on the
  environment are callable), so both are `initSearchPicker` /
  `autoInit` options, not macro parameters.
- **`action` is a macro parameter, overridable at init.** The macro
  renders it on the form's `action` attribute; the client reads that
  attribute (not the `form.action` property, which resolves to an
  absolute URL), and an init-time `action` wins.
- **`value` is initial only.** There is no two-way binding in a
  server-rendered template. The macro pre-fills the field; the client
  reads `input.value` at submit time, so typing is always what is
  searched for.
- **`children` becomes a `{% call %}` body.** It receives the canonical
  `ChildArgs` as a render-time snapshot, `{open: false, query: value}` —
  `open` is always `false` because the panel always renders closed, and
  the body is not re-rendered when either changes. The live open state
  is on the button's `aria-expanded`.
- **`class` / rest props become `classes` / `attributes`**, the
  catalog-wide Nunjucks convention.
- **Ids are derived from `name` / `id`**, not a module counter, because
  a macro has no counter shared across renders. `nextSearchPickerId()`
  is still exported for consumers building roots in JavaScript.

## 4. Public API

### 4.1 Macro parameters

`{% from "./search-picker.njk" import searchPicker %}` →
`{{ searchPicker(opts) }}`

| Key               | Type   | Required | Default                 | Purpose                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `label`           | string | yes      | —                       | Accessible name for the icon button and the search landmark.  |
| `inputLabel`      | string | yes      | —                       | Accessible name for the search field.                         |
| `submitLabel`     | string | yes      | —                       | Accessible name for the `⏎` submit button.                    |
| `placeholder`     | string | no       | —                       | Placeholder for the field. No default (it would be English).  |
| `value`           | string | no       | `""`                    | Initial text in the field.                                    |
| `action`          | string | no       | `"/"`                   | Path the query is appended to: `${action}?${query}`.          |
| `name`            | string | no       | `"search"`              | Discriminator used to derive ids.                             |
| `id`              | string | no       | `search-picker-{name}`  | Id prefix for the panel and field.                            |
| `classes`         | string | no       | —                       | Extra classes on the root.                                    |
| `attributes`      | object | no       | —                       | Extra HTML attributes spread onto the root.                   |
| `{% call %}` body | —      | no       | the default SVG icon    | Replaces the icon; receives `{open, query}` (see §3.3).       |

### 4.2 DOM contract

```html
<div class="search-picker {classes}" data-lily-search-picker-root data-lily-search-picker-name="{name}">
  <button type="button" class="search-picker-button" aria-label="{label}"
          aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="{id}-panel" data-lily-search-picker-button>
    <svg class="search-picker-icon" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="1.05rem" height="1.05rem" aria-hidden="true" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.6" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="7" cy="7" r="4.5"/><path d="M10.5 10.5 14 14"/></svg>
  </button>
  <div class="search-picker-panel" id="{id}-panel" hidden data-lily-search-picker-panel>
    <form class="search-picker-form" role="search" aria-label="{label}" action="{action}" method="get" data-lily-search-picker-form>
      <input class="search-picker-input" id="{id}-input" type="search" aria-label="{inputLabel}"
             placeholder="{placeholder}" value="{value}" enterkeyhint="search" data-lily-search-picker-input>
      <button type="submit" class="search-picker-submit" aria-label="{submitLabel}" data-lily-search-picker-submit>
        <span class="search-picker-submit-symbol" aria-hidden="true">⏎</span>
      </button>
    </form>
  </div>
</div>
```

`placeholder` and `value` are omitted entirely when not supplied. The
submit button follows the field in DOM order, so it sits at the field's
right in left-to-right layouts (and at its left under `dir="rtl"`).
Ids are deterministic and SSR-safe: `{id}-panel`, `{id}-input`.

### 4.3 client.js exports

`initSearchPicker`, `autoInit`, `RETURN_SYMBOL` (the bare `⏎`),
`searchHref(query, action = "/")`, `nextSearchPickerId`.

`initSearchPicker(root, opts?)` opts: `action`, `navigate(href)`,
`onSearch(query, href)`. Returns `{open, close, search, destroy}`;
`search(query?)` runs the §5.1 submit path for `query` (default: the
field's current text). `autoInit(opts?)` wires every
`[data-lily-search-picker-root]` on the page.

## 5. Behaviour

### 5.1 Searching

Return in the field or activating the submit button submits the form.
The client cancels the native submission, trims the query, and — when it
is non-empty — fires `onSearch(query, href)`, closes the panel, and calls
`navigate(href)` (default `location.assign(href)`), where
`href = searchHref(query, action)`. An empty or whitespace-only query
does nothing and leaves the panel open.

### 5.2 Keyboard

| Key               | On the icon button          | In the panel                                    |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `Enter` / `Space` | Opens (or closes) the panel | In the field: `Enter` searches. On ⏎: searches. |
| `Escape`          | —                           | Closes and returns focus to the icon button     |
| `Tab`             | Moves on                    | Native order: field → ⏎ → out, which closes     |

Opening moves focus into the search field. Clicking outside, or focus
moving to an element outside the root, closes the panel without moving
focus. A focusout with no `relatedTarget` does **not** close it: Safari
does not focus a `<button>` on click, so pressing `⏎` (or the icon
button) blurs the field with no new focus target, and closing there
would hide the panel before the click lands. Every focus move the
client makes passes `{ preventScroll: true }`.

## 6. Degradation without JavaScript

Without the client module the control does nothing, and the spec says so
plainly: the panel is rendered `hidden`, only the client removes that,
and the icon button has no handler. The form is therefore unreachable.
This matches the canonical contract (the field carries no `name`, so a
native submission would not produce `/?<query>` in any case). A site
that needs a no-JS search should render its own always-visible
`<form role="search">`. See `docs/ssr.md`.

## 7. Testing acceptance criteria

`search-picker.test.ts` asserts every clause below. Clauses 1–24 map 1:1
onto the canonical Svelte spec's §7; 25–27 cover the Nunjucks-specific
surface.

1. Renders a `<button class="search-picker-button">` named by `label`, with `aria-expanded="false"` and `aria-controls` naming the panel.
2. The panel is hidden until the button is activated; activating opens it (`aria-expanded="true"`), activating again closes it.
3. The default icon is an `aria-hidden` SVG `.search-picker-icon`.
4. A `{% call %}` body replaces the icon and receives `ChildArgs` (`open`, `query`) as a render-time snapshot.
5. The panel holds a `<form role="search">` named by `label`, a `type="search"` field named by `inputLabel`, and a `type="submit"` button named by `submitLabel` after the field.
6. The submit button's visible content is `⏎` in an `aria-hidden` span.
7. Opening focuses the search field with `{ preventScroll: true }`.
8. Pressing Return in the field (submitting the form) navigates to `/?<query>`: `foo` → `/?foo`, and the native form submission is cancelled.
9. Clicking the submit button navigates the same way.
10. The query is trimmed and URI-encoded: `  foo bar ` → `/?foo%20bar`, `a&b` → `/?a%26b`.
11. An empty or whitespace-only query does not navigate and leaves the panel open.
12. `action` changes the path: `action: "/search"` sends `foo` to `/search?foo`; an init-time `action` wins.
13. `onSearch` fires with the trimmed query and the href, before `navigate`.
14. Without `navigate`, the default calls `location.assign(href)`.
15. A search closes the panel.
16. `Escape` closes the panel and returns focus to the button with `{ preventScroll: true }`.
17. Clicking outside closes the panel.
18. Focus moving to an element outside the root closes the panel.
19. An initial `value` pre-fills the field, and typing replaces it.
20. `searchHref()` builds the same destination the component navigates to.
21. `RETURN_SYMBOL` is the bare `⏎` (U+23CE).
22. `classes` is appended to `search-picker` on the root, and `attributes` spread onto the root.
23. The macro renders no user-facing text of its own: with no `placeholder` the field has none, and the only text node is the `aria-hidden` `⏎`.
24. A focusout with no `relatedTarget` (Safari's click on `⏎` or on the icon button, a window blur) leaves the panel open, so the click that caused it still lands.
25. Ids are deterministic, derived from `name` / `id`, and wired to `aria-controls`.
26. `autoInit` wires every root; `initSearchPicker` is inert on a missing or foreign root; the returned `open` / `close` / `search` work and `destroy` removes the listeners.
27. `nextSearchPickerId` mints stable, incrementing, SSR-safe ids.

§6 is asserted too: without the client the panel stays hidden, and the
macro touches no document, storage, or navigator state.
