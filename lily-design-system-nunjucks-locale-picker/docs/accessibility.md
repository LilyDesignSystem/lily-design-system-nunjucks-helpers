# Accessibility

The picker targets **WCAG 2.2 AAA** and implements the WAI-ARIA APG
Radio Group pattern. This page lists what's built in and what
remains the consumer's responsibility.

## Built-in

| WCAG / APG item | How the picker satisfies it |
| --------------- | --------------------------- |
| WCAG 3.1.1 Language of Page | The client.js writes `lang` to the document root on every locale change. |
| WCAG 3.1.2 Language of Parts | The macro emits `lang="{tag}"` on each option `<label>`. |
| WCAG 1.4.10 Reflow (RTL bidi) | The client.js writes `dir="rtl"` for RTL locales. |
| WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value | `<fieldset role="radiogroup" aria-label>` exposes the group; `<input type="radio">` exposes each option. |
| WCAG 2.1.1 Keyboard | Tab into the group; Arrow keys move selection; Space selects — all from native radio semantics. |
| WCAG 2.4.7 Focus Visible | The browser's default focus ring is preserved; the picker never sets `outline: none`. |
| WCAG 1.4.1 Use of Color | Selection state is announced via `aria-checked` and reflected in the `lang` attribute — not colour alone. |
| APG Radio Group pattern | Single-selection radio group with one `tabindex=0` representative — provided by the platform. |

## Per-option `lang` is important

The default rendering wraps each option in a
`<label lang="…">`. This satisfies WCAG 3.1.2 (Language of
Parts): when a screen reader encounters the option "Français"
inside an English page, the `lang` attribute makes the reader
switch to a French voice for the duration of that span.

Without the per-option `lang`, "Français" gets pronounced
"Franc-ess" in an English voice — comprehensible but ugly. With
it, the reader says "Fran-SAY".

The same logic applies when you render a `<select>` via the
caller block. Always carry the locale's BCP 47 tag onto each
`<option>`:

```njk
<select>
    {% for code in locales %}
    <option value="{{ code }}" lang="{{ code | replace('_', '-') }}">
        {{ labelFor(code) }}
    </option>
    {% endfor %}
</select>
```

## Keyboard contract

| Key                    | Action                                                          |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tab                    | Move focus into the radio group, landing on the checked option (or the first option if none is checked). |
| Tab again              | Move focus out of the group entirely; the group counts as one stop. |
| Arrow keys (`↑ ↓ ← →`) | Move selection between options inside the group. Selection follows focus by default in native radios. |
| Space                  | Select the focused option if it isn't already.                  |
| Home / End             | (Some browsers) Select first / last option.                     |

This is all native behaviour. The client.js does not add JS
keyboard handlers — it doesn't need to.

## Focus management on locale change

By default the focused element stays focused when the locale
changes. This is the WCAG 3.2.2 (On Input) contract: changing a
setting must not cause a focus or context change. Avoid hard
navigations in `onChange` that scroll the page; if you must
navigate, scroll-restore to the picker's position so the user
can keep choosing.

## Screen-reader behaviour matrix

| Reader     | OS       | Browser   | What's announced when user lands on the group |
| ---------- | -------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| VoiceOver  | macOS 14 | Safari 17 | "Language, group" → "English, selected, radio button, 1 of 5". Arrow announces the next option's `lang`-correct pronunciation. |
| NVDA       | Windows  | Firefox   | "Language grouping" → "English radio button checked 1 of 5". Pronounces "Français" in French voice if French voice installed. |
| JAWS       | Windows  | Chrome    | "Language group, English radio button checked, 1 of 5". |
| TalkBack   | Android  | Chrome    | "Language, English, radio button, 1 of 5, double-tap to activate". |

The "lang-correct pronunciation" depends on the reader having a
matching voice package installed.

## When per-option `lang` does NOT help

If your `localeLabels` are all in the **viewer's** language
(e.g. you show "English", "French", "Arabic" — all in English so
the user recognises them), the per-option `lang` attribute is
technically incorrect. In that case, drop the `lang` attribute
by using the caller-block pattern to render your own
`<label>` without `lang`.

## Native `<select>` accessibility

Native `<select>` is fully accessible:

- Keyboard: Enter / Space / Down arrow open the picker; typing
  searches; Escape closes.
- Screen reader: announces "combobox" + label + current value +
  count.
- Mobile: pops the OS-native picker (iOS scroll wheel, Android
  dialog).

The tradeoff vs radios:

- Compact (one widget instead of N).
- Scales to 100+ locales.
- Choices hidden until opened (worse discoverability).
- Can't show option text in mixed scripts as easily.

For 2–8 locales, prefer the radio default. For 9+, prefer
`<select>` or combobox.

## Combobox / listbox

For 50+ locales, a combobox with type-ahead is the right pattern.
The APG Combobox specification is intricate (focus-on-listbox vs
focus-on-input, auto-complete vs none, vertical vs grid). This
helper doesn't ship a combobox; use the caller block to render
your own combobox markup or use the upstream Lily
`Combobox` headless primitive.

See [examples/10-combobox.njk](../examples/10-combobox.njk) for a
minimal in-line combobox built on a `<datalist>` (≈APG Combobox
with List Autocomplete and Manual Selection).

## Colour contrast

The picker ships no colour. WCAG 1.4.3 contrast (4.5:1 normal,
3:1 large, 7:1 AAA) is your CSS's responsibility. A safe default
for the radio dot's checked state:

```css
.locale-picker-option:has(input:checked) {
    color: #003087; /* NHS blue */
    font-weight: 600;
}
```

The focus ring should also meet WCAG 2.4.13 Focus Appearance — a
minimum 2px-wide outline that contrasts with both the focused
element and the background.

## RTL focus order

In RTL layout, focus moves **visually right-to-left** but
**logically** in source order. So Tab still moves through the
radios in the order they appear in your `locales` array, and
Arrow Right (in RTL) moves to the previous option, not the
next. This is the browser's job, not yours.
